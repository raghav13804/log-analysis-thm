# log-analysis-thm
Basic log analysis to detect suspicious activity using TryHackMe lab.

### Project: Intro to Log Analysis (TryHackMe)

In this project, I used a simulated SOC environment to analyze Windows event logs.  
I identified failed login attempts, suspicious user activity, and indicators of brute-force attacks.

üõ†Ô∏è Skills Used:  
- Log Analysis  
- Threat Detection  
- Event Log Correlation  
- SOC Investigation Thinking

üïµÔ∏è Key Findings:  
- Host: WIN-SERVER-01  
- Suspicious IP: 203.0.113.4  
- Pattern: 7 failed login attempts within 2 minutes
